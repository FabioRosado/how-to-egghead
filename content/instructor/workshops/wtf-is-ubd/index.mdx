_Understanding by Design_ is an instructional design framework that our workshop planning process is built on.

One of UbD's most important features is the practice of Backwards Design.


## Determine the Goals

We start with the ultimate understanding goal of the workshop, and the milestones that lead there.

In the end, someone should be able to transfer what they learn in the workshop setting to their future "real world" projects.

As we determine the goals and milestone outcomes of the workshop, we determine the understandings that we want learners to come away with.

## Understandings and Essential Questions

Understandings include the meaning-making rules, guidelines, and theories. The artful parts of the subject at hand.

Let's take a look at this example understanding: "There are many ways to display and organize quantitative data".

This statement is more than just a fact. It encompasses factual knowledge (e.g. "Quantitative data are concerned with numbers") and skills (e.g. "How to draw a bar chart"), both of which might be unpacked into even more facts & skills.

Just as important are the **Essential Questions** that build and deepen understanding.

The essential questions are the guide posts of the workshop. These are questions that the learner will ask themselves as they work to build understanding. Usually there won't be a single answer, and may shift depending on the context.

Continuing with our example above, essential questions could include "What type of visualization would be most effective?" or "How else could this data be presented?".

## Acquisition of Knowledge and Skill

For each of the workshop goals & desired understandings, we want to capture the knowledge and skills a person will throughout the workshop. What is the vocabulary involved? What are the steps to performing a task?

If we were planning a workshop on working with JavaScript Arrays, we would want learners to know that the `.map()` method will create a new array based on what is returned from a callback function called on every element of the original array. There is the vocabulary knowledge, as well as the skill of writing the syntax.

Many skills that are part of a curriculum (e.g. "Using `.map()` to create an array of doubled numbers") can be applied in future projects ("Do something with every item in this array, and keep track of the changes") after asking essential questions like "How should I approach working with this list of items?" 

## The Curriculum Plan
All of the above are captured in the *UbD Curriculum Outline*. This document is designed to help the instructor, egghead staff, and the learner to understand the scope of the workshop.

Like the UbD framework itself, we strive for continuous improvement for all the learners and instructors in all areas of workshop production.
