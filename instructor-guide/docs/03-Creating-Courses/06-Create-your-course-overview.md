## Create your course overview
When your course is "lesson complete," it's time to record a course overview. Guess what: It’s another lesson! But a lesson that serves as the trailer for your course.

Here’s a great example of an overview, from the course [Advanced React Component Patterns](https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-react-component-patterns) by Kent C. Dodds:

Here’s what Kent did so well:


- He **explained** the what, why, and how of the course. In under 2 minutes, you get a very good sense of the learning to come.
- He **showed “scenes”** from the lessons including some of the meatier elements covered in the course. It’s like a movie trailer: You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll learn.
- He **showed excitement** for the course. It's a bit of a sales pitch—much like the course proposal you created a while ago, but this time for learners’ approval.

Creating your course overview is the perfect way to conclude your production of the course. You get to stitch together “best-of” clips showing your instruction skills at work, act as your course’s hype person, and publish a publicly accessible video (all course overviews are public) that will look great in your portfolio.

Oh and, hey! Congratulations on publishing your first course! 🍾
