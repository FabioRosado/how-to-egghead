While slack is great for quick conversations and getting responses in real-time, it falls short when you need to search for a specific message or important conversation.

This is where email comes into play. Email is great for conversations that would benefit the whole team and act as a reference point moving forward.

Great topics include problems or bugs you've encoutered when updating code and the solutions you've tried, efficiency tips that you've found work well for yourself, and general questions about process that don't seem clear. 

If you've run into a problem, chances are, someone else on the team has or will run into the same issue as you! 

For email, egghead uses a service called TopicBox that creates topic 'buckets' that members in the team can subscribe to. Once subscribed, all you have to do is email a particular bucket and the whole team will get said email.

For the content team, we have `content@talk.egghead.io` set up for discussions surrounding egghead content.
