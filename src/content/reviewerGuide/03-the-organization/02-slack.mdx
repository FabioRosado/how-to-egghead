## Asynchronous Communication

Because team members are spread across the globe, our primary form of communication is asynchronous. We use [Slack](https://slack.com/features) as the day to day tool for questions that need to be answered immediately as well as a place to post work and ask for reviews.

After you're first review, you'll be invited to both slack and the channels relevant to review.

The primary channel used for content review is the `content-team` channel. This is where we discuss outdated content, bugs when updating code, and any other questions you might have.

It's also highly recommended to share any personal projects your working on in this channel! We are all here to get better and sharing ideas and feedback is key!
